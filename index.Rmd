## Welcome!

<img src="images/home.jpg" style="width:35%">

My name is Sarah Younes, and I am currently a second-year Master of Public Health (MPH) candidate at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. I am in the Department of Sociomedical Sciences and I am pursuing a certificate in Public Health Research Methods.

Thank you for visiting my website -- I am happy you are here!

## Career goals

Upon receiving my MPH, I hope to continue working in research and evaluation in mental, behavioral, or sexual and reproductive health. My belief in the power of empirical data to create change and my curiosity attract me to research and program evaluation positions, and I value the ability to translate findings into action, whether that is to directly develop effective interventions or programs or advise policy-making. The possibility of working to support this implementation stage further drives me to work in research and evaluation for public health.
