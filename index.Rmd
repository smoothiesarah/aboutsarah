## Welcome!

<img src="images/home.jpg" style="width:50%">

My name is Sarah Younes, and I am currently a second-year Master of Public Health (MPH) candidate at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. I am in the Sociomedical Sciences and I am pursuing a certificate in Public Health Research Methods.

Thank you for visiting my website -- I am happy you're here!

## Career goals

Upon receiving my MPH, I hope to continue working in research and evaluation in mental, behavioral, or sexual and reproductive health. I am interested in working at organizations whose goals are to translate their work into action, whether that is to directly develop effective interventions or programs or advise policy-making. The possibility of working to support this implementation stage is what drives me to work in research and evaluation for public health.
